# Personalized-GPT
A GPT with a personalized face and a voice 

🧠 Project Overview

- You’re building a custom AI assistant with:

- Conversational intelligence (GPT-like responses)

- Visual avatar (face that animates while speaking)

- Voice interaction (speech-to-text and text-to-speech)

- Multilingual support

- Personalization layer (user memory, preferences, etc.)

- Web or desktop interface

🏗️ Step-by-Step Build Plan

1. 🔧 Tech Stack Setup

Choose your stack:
- Frontend: React (with Three.js or Babylon.js for 3D avatar), or Electron for desktop
- Backend: FastAPI or Flask (Python)
- AI Model: OpenAI GPT-4 API or open-source alternatives like LLaMA2, Mistral

Voice:
- STT: Whisper or Google Speech API
- TTS: ElevenLabs, Coqui, or Azure TTS

Avatar: Ready Player Me, D-ID, or custom WebGL rig

Multilingual NLP: Use GPT-4 with language hints or integrate BLOOM

2. 🧠 GPT Integration

- Set up GPT API calls with streaming support
- Build a chat loop: user input → GPT → response
- Add system prompts for personality and memory
- Store user preferences in a local DB (SQLite or DynamoDB)

3. 🗣️ Voice Interaction

Speech-to-Text:
- Use Whisper locally or Google Speech API
- Trigger GPT response on voice input

Text-to-Speech:
- Use ElevenLabs or Azure TTS for natural voice
- Sync TTS output with avatar mouth movement

4. 🧍 Avatar Integration

Choose avatar platform:
- D-ID: Realistic talking face from text
- Ready Player Me + Three.js: Custom 3D avatar

Sync avatar with TTS output:
- Animate mouth and expressions based on phonemes or audio waveform
- Optional: Add eye tracking, gestures

5. 🌐 Multilingual Support

-Detect language using langdetect or GPT

- oute input/output through GPT with system prompt:

Code
You are a multilingual assistant. Respond in the same language as the user.
Add UI language toggle for manual override

6. 🧬 Personalization Engine

Create user profile schema:

json
{
  "name": "Chavi",
  "language": "en",
  "interests": ["AWS", "Terraform", "Python"],
  "tone": "friendly",
  "memory": {
    "last_topic": "Lambda packaging"
  }
}
Store and retrieve memory per session

Inject memory into GPT system prompt dynamically

7. 🖥️ Frontend UI

Chat interface with:
- Avatar window
- Voice input button
- Text input fallback
- Language selector

Optional: Desktop app via Electron or mobile via React Native

8. 🚀 Deployment

Host backend on:
- AWS EC2 or Lambda (with API Gateway)
- Use Terraform to automate infra

Frontend:
- Vercel, Netlify, or S3 static hosting
- Secure with HTTPS, CORS, and rate limiting

🧪 Bonus Features (if time allows)

🎭 Emotion detection from voice tone
🧩 Plugin system for tasks (e.g., weather, calendar)
🧠 Local LLM fallback for offline mode
🗂️ Conversation history and export
